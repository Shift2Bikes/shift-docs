# Overview

The purpose of the Shift/Pedalpalooza Calendar is to empower citizens to create and view bike events and to spread bike fun.

# Software

built using:
- php
- docker
- [hugo v0.37.1](https://gohugo.io) 
- && the theme ["Universal"](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-universal-theme/)
- && the content from [the legacy shift website](https://old.shift2bikes.org)
- && [Netlify web hosting](https://www.netlify.com) to serve the content
- && [the Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org)

You can see the live site here:  https://www.shift2bikes.org

## Contributing

- If you want to change something about the site configuration or theme, [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) are welcome.  Once you create a PR, you can immediately check out [a link to the build status and log and a preview of your changes](https://app.netlify.com/sites/shift-docs/deploys)
- If you only want to edit CONTENT rather than any code or site styling, (including creating new pages), [this doc tells how](/docs/UPDATING.md)

## Local development

Following the below steps you'll have a copy of the site running, including 3 docker containers running nginx, db, and the php server:

1. install docker
2. clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/Shift2Bikes/shift-docs.git`
3. clone submodules `git submodule update --init --recursive`
4. start shift site `./shift up`
5. visit `https://localhost:4443/`

Note that no changes to the filesystems INSIDE the container should ever be needed;  they read from your LOCAL filesystem so updating the local FS will show up in the container (perhaps after a restart).  Updating, changing branches, etc can be done with git commands OUTIDE of the container (`git checkout otherbranch` or `git pull`).


## Netlify deployment

You can easily run your own copy of the site with these two steps.  This could help you do theme development in your own repo before submitting your finished write-up to us for incorporation.

1. [fork repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
2. [deploy on Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/start) by linking your forked repo.  Included configuration file `netlify.toml` should mean 0 additional configuration required to get the site running.

If you have trouble with it please [file an issue](https://github.com/shift-org/shift-docs/issues/new) to let us know what you tried and what happened when you did.

# Development Overview

* Vincent has a number of wrappers and files that set up the docker environment


# Important Project Files

* docker-compose.yml
  * docker container settings
  * The defined containers (db, node, etc) become pingable host names from the other running containers.  For example, attached to the node container, you can "ping db"
  * Contains the container specific mappings between host and docker container persistent volumes for example for the node container:

    volumes:
      - ./borzoi/node/:/opt/borzoi/node/
      - ./app:/home/node/app

* shift
  * Vincent's convenience wrapper that sets up the environment and has various convenience docker commands
  * contains environment variables that get loaded and are then available for docker to import.  Docker environment variables that will be important are defined separately for each container (see: docker-compose.yml).  Run "env" inside an attached docker container to see the variables that made it into the running container.

* borzoi/borzoi.sh
  * The environment file that is loaded by the shift script 


# Shift Commands (Vincent's Wrapper Stuff)

* ./shift attach node 
  * `node` is a reference to the named docker container.  Note that you want just `nginx`, `db` or `php` not the full image name (`shift_nginx_1`)
  * Attaches to the running docker container in the shift stack
* ./shift up
  * Starts up the docker containers (will also restart)
* ./shift logs nginx
  * Will start tailing the logs for the specified container (nginx in this case)
  * multiple container names can be mentioned
* ./shift down
  * stops the docker containers

# Docker Daemon Commands

* docker ps
  * lists all of the running process and port information from docker (ex: you can see the postgres service port)
* docker volume ls  
  * This will show the persistent volumes that docker knows about. The shift project volumes are prefixed with shift_
  * The "shift_" docker namespace comes from the shift file: export COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME="shift"

# Sequalize Setup

```bash 
npm install --save pg pg-hstore
bash npm install --save sequelize
```
