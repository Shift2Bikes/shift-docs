This is a big ball o wax.

Shift has webhosting through canvashost, a local service provider who gives us a reasonably good deal.  The charge is currently hooked to chris (fool)'s paypal so please don't add services without talking to him!


domains are registered through [Dotster](https://www.dotster.com) and are hooked to fool's credit card:

- shift2bikes.org
- shift2bikes.com
- shifttobikes.org
- shifttobikes.com

pedalpalooza.org needs to be transferred from its current registrar soon;  brian scrivner still controls that.

Several people can login, including chris fool and brian scrivner.

steve kirkendall, thom wilburn still retain access and were longtime caretakers.

Site is in php, talks to a mysql database that is backed up semi-regularly.

while some of the old calendar website codebase is in github:

https://github.com/Shift2Bikes/shiftcal/tree/Legacy

the [new/current calendar](http://shift2bikes.org/fun2/) is its own codebase in github:

https://github.com/Shift2Bikes/shiftcal/tree/master

The [new website](https://new.shift2bikes.org) is also in github:

https://github.com/fool/shift-docs

...and has an online bit about contributing too:  https://new.shift2bikes.org/pages/website-development/

These are both "in progress"
