[Umbrella](https://umbrellapdx.org) **really** wants to be spoken to like this:

1. shift liaison (pre-designated and introducted to board)
2. talks to umbrella liaison to shift directly about all things

On occasion, the board will ask to meet with the liaison to talk about things but in general the communication is 1:1 no matter if shift has a "finance committee" so that there aren't too many cooks in the kitchen.

If money is donated, umbrella takes 10% off the top upon receipt.  Donations via square/facebook additionally have fees withdrawn so if someone wants to give shift $500 - try to get them to write a check instead of paypal'ing

Umbrella owns the bank account and enables shift to accept donations - it's a 501(c)3 nonprofit.  This puts some limitations on the activities shift can officially do - the liaisons from shift/umbrella should DEFINITELY talk before shift does anything "official" and political.  ("shift kickoff ride for mayoral candidate X" or "shift signs petition to congress to Y" or "shift fundraises for or donates to any political campaign" are EXPLICITLY verboten).

Umbrella in general issues checks directly to folks whom the liaison provides:

- a request
- receipts for the expense

to umbrella for.  

Current liaisons are lale.santelices@umbrellapdx.org @ umbrella and chris "fool" mccraw (gently@gmail.com).
