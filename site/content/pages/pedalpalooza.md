## About

Pedalpalooza is an annual festival in Metro Portland, Oregon.  During the festival, there are hundreds of volunteer-organized free bike events.

<p style="padding: 1em; color: #663300; border: 1px solid #FFDD66; background: #FCFAF2; font-weight: bold;"><strong>This year will be something different! Pedalpalooza 2020 is about individuals finding ways to celebrate the joy of cycling — separate, but together.</strong></p>

Pedalpalooza 2020 starts on the 1st of June and ends on the 5th of July — over a full month of bike fun! Check the <a href="/pedalpalooza-calendar/">Pedalpalooza calendar</a> and [Pedalpalooza.org](https://www.pedalpalooza.org/) for details.

## History

 The tradition of a summer bike fun festival in Portland started in Summer of 2002, when the nomadic [BikeSummer festival](http://criticalmass.wikia.com/wiki/Bike_Summer!) came to Portland.  We had so much fun that we decided we should keep having bike fun festivals and went through a couple of iterations - including [Mini Bike Summer](/pedalpalooza/pedalpalooza-2003/) in 2003 before Pedalpalooza was dreamed up in 2004. It's happened every year since then, and grown quite a bit!
